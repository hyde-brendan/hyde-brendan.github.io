## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Considering I've been using CSS Grid for nearly all my previous solutions, a challenge focusing on using grids was pretty simple for me. Nothing too notable for me to talk about this time!

### Continued development

You may notice that there's a simple scale effect whenever you hover over a card. I actually wanted to make it skew slightly to achieve a 3D effect, but I wasn't really sure how to do it. Attempts just looked off to me, so I decided to put it off for now.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's 'Learn CSS Grid the easy way' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - For a generalized introduction to CSS grid, Kevin uses this specific Frontend Mentor challenge to show how to use grid to achieve the layout of this design. I didn't use it for this, but I have watched the video in the past, and I highly recommend it if you're new to CSS grid.
