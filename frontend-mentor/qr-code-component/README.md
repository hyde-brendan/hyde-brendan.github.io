## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since this was added while I was already halfway through all the Newbie-level challenges, I didn't get around to doing this until now, as the final (free) challenge I had yet to complete. I'll be moving along onto the Junior-level challenges next.

Obviously this particular challenge would be a pretty quick one, only taking me around 20 minutes to do. As such I didn't really learn anything new, just tried to reinforce things like on-hover animation and semantic HTML markup.

### Continued development
