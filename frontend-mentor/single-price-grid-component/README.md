## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not too much going on this time around, just a quick and simple project using `grid-template-areas` for the cards' placements. I have been trying to get more into the habit of using more utility classes, though; not sure if this is the best practice but it's probably better than just having all the CSS in the `div` elements themselves.
