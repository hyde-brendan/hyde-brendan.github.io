## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Not too learnt on this particular challenge, just a nice and simple practice reinforcing my knowledge on using `grid-template-areas` to cool down after the kinda frustrating time I had with the tooltip for the [Article preview component challenge](https://github.com/hyde-brendan/hyde-brendan.github.io/tree/main/frontend-mentor/article-preview-component). I even added a tablet layout for the cards, and little `scale()` animation when hovering over a card!

### Continued development

Originally when I was adding the `:hover` animation, I wanted a neat effect where the colored outline on top would wipe around the card for a full colored outline, but chose against it because I didn't have a clean solution for adjusting for the padding change, or because I didn't exactly know how to do it; would it be something like setting delays for a continuous stroke? How would it start from one end?

I'd like to play around with that in the future.
